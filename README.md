# isc-proposal

We want to help R developers to leverage serverless computing for training and scoring R models. We want to build a platform independent framework that allows R developers to deploy their solution to different cloud providers with a consistent, unified API. Therefore, R users will finally have seamless access to cloud infrastructure.

This is similar to the advantages that were created by the [serverless.com](http://serverless.com/)-framework but specifically targeted to R users: automatic scaling, pay-per execution and low overhead costs. 

R developers should be able to:

- deploy arbitrary R code using an arbitary R runtime
- use a consistent API for selected cloud providers

We want to build an R package to provision:

- serverless batch jobs
- serverless functions
